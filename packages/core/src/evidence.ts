 * This module owns the durable, single-owner storage contract for computer-use
 * evidence: a session-scoped active-run pointer, an append-only action journal
 * (`actions.jsonl`), a byte cap with one deterministic truncation marker, and
 * finalized-run retention. It deliberately wires no producers — no MCP tool,
 * relay, or screenshot policy calls into it yet.
 *
 * Invariants:
 * - The manifest is single-owner summary data. The journal is authoritative;
 *   appending an action never rewrites the manifest.
 * - A recoverable cross-process lock serializes tail repair, cap accounting, and
 *   one verified `O_APPEND` write of each bounded, newline-terminated record.
 * - Reads are deterministic: a torn final line is dropped and repaired before the
 *   next append; any corruption before the final line is rejected.
