// Linux graphical `sudo` (askpass) capability detection —
// pickforge/picklab#27.
//
// Implements the *detection* half of the "Shared graphical sudo (askpass)
// security contract — locked v1" pinned on that issue (shared with
// pickforge/pickforge#215, which ships the same semantics in
// crates/pickforge-core/src/process/askpass.rs): Linux graphical sessions
// only, a fixed probe list (no dynamic discovery, no bundled helper), and
// fail-closed when nothing resolves. The *injection* half — passing
// `SUDO_ASKPASS`, and only that variable, into the spawned privileged
// command — lives in ./executor.ts (materializePrivilegedStep), since
// PickLab programmatically issues `sudo -A` rather than hosting an
// interactive shell the way PickForge does.
//
// Scope: macOS/Windows are out of scope for this release.
// `detectAskpassCapability` is a pure function so every branch — including
// the user-set-vs-probe-list priority order — is directly testable on any
// host; only `resolveAskpassCapability` gates real filesystem probing to
// Linux, matching where the feature actually activates.
