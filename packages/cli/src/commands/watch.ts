 * `internal takeover-watchdog` command, which polls the lease independently
 * and actively reclaims a stale writable VNC on its own; see
 * `runTakeoverWatchdogLoop` for why a detached process was chosen over
 * OS-level parent-death coupling. If there is no known entry point to
 * re-invoke (unexpected outside a real CLI process), spawning is skipped —
 * the immediate-end-on-renew-failure and hard-deadline-timer mechanisms in
 * *this* process still hold the invariant; only the crash-of-this-process

/**
 * Hold a human lease for the duration of the viewer wait, heartbeating it

 * outliving the lease in wall-clock terms (pickforge/picklab#21 P0-A),
 * never only "the next time something happens to touch the session":
 *
 * 1. The first failed renewal ends the takeover *immediately* — it does not
 *    wait for the viewer to close, since a renewal failure means the lease
 *    is already gone (see `renewHumanTakeover`/#21 P0-B).
 * 2. A hard deadline timer, rescheduled to the fresh `expiresAt` on every
 *    successful renewal, force-ends the takeover if wall-clock time ever
 *    passes the lease's expiry regardless of what the heartbeat interval
 *    itself observed — belt-and-suspenders against e.g. a stalled interval
 *    callback.
 * 3. A detached watchdog process (`defaultSpawnWatchdog`) covers the case
 *    where *this* process itself crashes and neither of the above can run
 *    at all.
 *
 * A terminal-wide SIGINT (the common interactive-cancel path) reaches the
 * viewer child too, since `openVncViewer` spawns it in our process group —
 * the signal handler here exists so *our* process does not exit before
 * running cleanup, not to itself interrupt the viewer.
 * `runControlledViewer` always ends the takeover (VNC reverted, lease
 * released, watchdog stopped) before returning or throwing.
