/**
 * Actively reclaim a writable VNC session if its human lease goes stale,
 * independent of the takeover-owning process's own lifetime.
 *
 * This is the crash-path half of the "writable VNC never outlives its
 * lease" invariant (pickforge/picklab#21 P0-A): `picklab watch --control`
 * spawns this loop as a **detached** child process (own process group, not
 * killed by a `SIGKILL` of its parent — see
 * `packages/cli/src/commands/watch.ts`), so a crash of the controlling
 * process does not leave writable VNC running until some later, unrelated
 * operation happens to touch the session. That would be a *lazy* reclaim —
 * correct eventually, but with no wall-clock bound — and is rejected: the
 * watchdog polls on its own schedule, in its own process, and actively stops
 * a stale writable VNC (via the same TOCTOU-safe `recoverStaleHumanLease`
 * used elsewhere) the first time it observes the lease has gone stale.
 *
 * A short-lived detached process was chosen over OS-level parent-death
 * coupling (e.g. Linux `PR_SET_PDEATHSIG`) because the latter has no
 * portable Node.js API — it needs either a native addon or an external
 * wrapper binary not guaranteed to be present — while a detached sibling
 * process is plain, dependency-free Node/TypeScript consistent with the rest
 * of this codebase, and the existing `recoverStaleHumanLease` primitive
 * already does exactly the reclaim work this loop needs to trigger.
 *
 * Exits on its own — no external signal needed — as soon as the lease it is
 * watching is gone or has been superseded by a different lease (the
 * takeover it was watching ended, one way or another) or once it has
 * actively reclaimed a stale one. The controlling process additionally
 * terminates it directly on a clean end, for promptness; this self-exit is
 * the backstop if that termination itself is lost (e.g. the controlling
 * process crashes before it can send the signal).
