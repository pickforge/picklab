# Unreleased

Working draft for the next PickLab release. Keep this current while PRs land.
At release time, use it to polish the generated GitHub release description,
then reset this file.

## User-facing changes

- `desktop_launch` now points `WAYLAND_DISPLAY` at a non-existent socket (and
  strips `WAYLAND_SOCKET`), so GTK/Qt/Electron/Flutter apps always fall back
  to X11 and render inside the isolated lab display instead of opening on the
  user's real Wayland desktop (where driving them moved the real cursor).

## Internal/release changes

- None yet.

## Validation

### Tested

- Regression test asserting launched apps get `DISPLAY=<lab display>` with
  Wayland variables unset; full desktop-linux integration suite (Xvfb +
  xdotool + xterm) passes.

### Not tested yet

- App build.
- Installer or updater flow.
- Platform smoke checks.

### Release blockers

- None known.
