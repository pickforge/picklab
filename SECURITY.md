# Security

PickLab automates real software on your machine. It spawns and drives native
desktop apps and Android emulators, starts a local X display (Xvfb) and an
optional VNC server, and runs ADB. Treat it like any tool that can launch
processes and read screens: run it on hardware you control, against code you
trust.

This is the honest short version. The [README](README.md#security-model) has the
fuller model.

## Boundaries

- MCP tools never invoke sudo. Privileged provisioning happens only through the
  CLI, with explicit consent.
- User input is spawned as argument arrays, never interpolated into shell strings.
- Logcat and other artifacts are redacted by default. Only `android adb` is raw,
  and it says so.
- Agent config edits are atomic, with a backup of the previous config.

## Recorded evidence and screenshots

Computer-use evidence is stored as local run data, by default under
`~/.pickforge/picklab/projects/<projectId>/runs/<runId>/` (outside the
project; see the README's "Run storage" section for storage modes).
`actions.jsonl` is the authoritative sanitized timeline; finalization
produces an escaped, no-script `report.html` with a restrictive content
security policy and no external requests.

The recorder persists only allowlisted metadata. Typed and filled text becomes
length plus input type. Failed network records keep method, URL origin/path
without the query, status, resource type, timing, and a sanitized error
classification. Request/response headers and bodies are dropped. Cookie,
authorization, session, JWT, CSRF, OTP, query-token, and CDP capability values
are redacted or omitted before persistence.

**Screenshots are different: pixels cannot be redacted.** An explicitly
requested desktop, Android, or DevTools screenshot stores the screen exactly as
displayed and may therefore contain passwords, tokens, personal data, or other
secrets. PickLab never takes an implicit screenshot for typing/fill actions.
Do not explicitly capture a sensitive screen. Files are ordinary local files,
not encrypted storage; anyone who can read the project directory can read its
evidence.

Action evidence is enabled by default. Disable it per project when recording is
not appropriate:

```json
{
  "evidence": {
    "enabled": false
  }
}
```

This opt-out disables the action timeline and its screenshot association; it
does not block a screenshot command that was explicitly requested. The journal
and associated artifacts have a 100 MiB recording threshold per run. The
crossing record may exceed it; PickLab then writes one durable metadata-only
truncation marker and stops appending payloads. PickLab retains the latest 20
finalized evidence runs, while active/running and legacy runs are not pruned.

## VNC binds to loopback (SEC-01 — mitigated)

The desktop VNC server (`x11vnc`) is started with `-localhost`, so it listens on
`127.0.0.1` only and is not reachable from the network. It runs without a VNC
password (`-nopw`); that is safe precisely because the socket never leaves the
loopback interface. Normal `--vnc` and `picklab watch` observation is
server-enforced read-only (`-viewonly`): a connecting client cannot inject
keyboard or mouse input into the session, only watch it. `picklab watch`
starts this server lazily and closing its host-side viewer does not stop VNC,
Xvfb, or the session. `--vnc-control` is an explicit writable escape hatch for
entering a password, API key, or OTP directly into the lab app. Watch refuses
to reuse an active writable server rather than weakening its read-only
guarantee. Writable VNC does not yet pause or coordinate agent input, so stop
agent actions while using it. For remote viewing, forward the port over SSH:

```sh
# `session status` prints the VNC port (5900 + display number)
ssh -N -L <vncPort>:127.0.0.1:<vncPort> you@host
```

VNC PIDs are reused, reported alive, and stopped only when their persisted
process-start identity still matches. Session VNC creation and desktop/browser
destruction share one per-session mutation lock, preventing teardown races from
orphaning a late x11vnc process.

Do not strip `-localhost` to put VNC on a shared network. An unauthenticated,
all-interface VNC server is a remote-takeover risk.

## desktop_launch runs as you (SEC-02 — known limitation)

`desktop_launch` and the `desktop_*` input tools run the target app as the user
who started PickLab. There is no uid sandbox yet, so a launched app has your
filesystem and network access. PickLab provisions a dedicated locked
`picklab-lab` user and a dedicated `picklab-avd`, but session processes do not
yet run under that user — uid isolation is planned. Until then, launch only apps
you trust, and prefer a throwaway user or VM for untrusted binaries.

## Browser sessions run as you (SEC-03 — known limitation)

Browser sessions launch real headed Chrome/Chromium inside a private Xvfb
display. PickLab hardens the launch, but v1 is for authorized, trusted
development and QA — it is **not** a sandbox for hostile web pages.

What PickLab does do:

- Each session gets its own private Xvfb and its own **ephemeral** Chrome
  profile under the session directory. Profiles are never borrowed from your
  real browser and are deleted on destroy.
- Chrome starts from a **scrubbed environment** (`cleanEnv`): only the isolated
  display, isolated `HOME`/`XDG_*` paths, `PATH`, and locale reach it. Secrets
  in your shell environment are not inherited by the browser.
- The DevTools/CDP endpoint uses an OS-assigned port bound to loopback
  (`--remote-debugging-port=0` plus an explicit `127.0.0.1` address). It is not
  reachable off-host.
- The DevTools websocket path is a capability URL: whoever holds it controls the
  browser. PickLab reads only the port from `DevToolsActivePort` and **never**
  persists the websocket path/GUID in session records or diagnostics.
- `picklab browser devtools-mcp` resolves only a live browser session owned by the current project and derives `http://127.0.0.1:<port>` in memory. It accepts no arbitrary browser URL and stores no CDP endpoint or websocket GUID.
- The relay validates the installed `chrome-devtools-mcp` package name, exact `1.5.0` version, declared bin, and confined real path before starting it directly with Node (`shell: false`). Runtime `npx`, upstream update checks, and upstream usage statistics are disabled.
- Relay stdout contains only validated LF-delimited JSON-RPC records, with pending records capped at 16 MiB. Upstream stderr lines are capped at 64 KiB, redacted, and forwarded only to stderr; over-limit lines are dropped with a safe notice. Malformed or incomplete protocol input fails closed and terminates the upstream process.
- On destroy or reap, the whole Chrome **process group** is terminated and
  verified dead (PID plus `/proc` start-time identity, so a reused PID is never
  signalled) **before** the profile is deleted — no orphaned renderers, no
  leftover profile data.

What it does not do, and you must account for:

- **Loopback is not isolation from local processes.** Chrome and the CDP
  endpoint run as the user who started PickLab. Any local process running as
  that user can reach the loopback CDP port and drive the browser. Loopback
  binding only keeps the network out, not other local processes.
- There is **no uid sandbox** for the browser yet (same limitation as SEC-02).
  Launch only content you trust; prefer a throwaway user or VM otherwise.
- The official Chrome DevTools MCP runs with the same user privileges as PickLab and exposes its upstream tool surface without method filtering. An agent with access to `picklab-browser` can inspect and control the isolated browser; grant that MCP entry only to agents you trust.

Planned hardening tracked separately: per-session uid isolation, and moving CDP
off a TCP port onto `--remote-debugging-pipe`.
